                these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms
                include the provisions in this document as well as those in any other
                relevant policies. Your use of or participation in certain Services may
                also be subject to additional policies, rules and/or conditions
                (“Additional Terms”), which are incorporated herein by reference, and
                you understand and agree that by using or participating in any such
                Services, you agree to also comply with these Additional Terms.
                Please read these Terms carefully. They cover important information
                about Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill
                you. These Terms include information about future changes to these
                Terms, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, a class action
                waiver and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR
                SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO
                NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR

                <h2>Can terms change?</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may
                need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change the
                Terms at any time, and you are responsible for familiarizing yourself with
                any changes. If we determine that any changes to these Terms are
                material, we will place a notice on our site located at www.thirtyfriends.com,
                send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means.
                If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them;
                unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If
                you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective,
                that means you agree to all of the changes.
                Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or
                modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by
                both you and us.

                Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
                The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that
                online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly
                collect personally identifiable information online from children who are
                under thirteen (13). We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally
                identifiable information from children under thirteen (13); if you are a child
                under thirteen (13), please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use
                the Services or send us any personal information. If we learn we have
                collected personal information from a child under thirteen (13), we will

                <p>How to use Thirty Friends?
                You may be required to sign up for an account, select a password and user
                name (“Thirty Friends User ID”), and provide us with certain information or
                data, such as your contact information. You promise to provide us with
                accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself.
                You may not select as your Thirty Friends User ID a name that you do not
                have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to
                impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else
                without our prior written permission.
                You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a
                binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s
                permission to use the Services and have gotten your parent or guardian to
                agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on
                behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are
                authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization’s or entity’s behalf
                and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and
                “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization
                or entity). If there is a dispute between two or more persons or entities as to
                account ownership, Thirty Friends will have the power (but not the
                obligation) to be the sole arbiter of that dispute and Thirty Friends’ decision
                (which may include termination or suspension of the account) will be final
                and binding.
                You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal use, and not
                on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that
                complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is
                prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the
                Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in
                a way that breaks the law.
                You will not share your Thirty Friends User ID, account or password with
                anyone, and you must protect the security of your Thirty Friends User ID,
                account, password and any other access tools or credentials. You are and
                will be held responsible for any activity associated with your Thirty Friends
                User ID and account. You agree to immediately notify Thirty Friends of any
                unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of
                security. Thirty Friends will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from
                your failure to comply with this Section.
                Thirty Friends may provide you with the right to use a sub-domain within
                the Site (e.g., [sub-domain prefix].thirtyfriends.com) for a given event (a
                “Sub-Domain”). All Sub-Domains are the sole property of Thirty Friends
                and we reserve the right to determine the appearance, design, functionality
                and all other aspects of Sub-Domains. In the event Thirty Friends provides
                you with access to a Sub-Domain, your right to use such Sub-Domain will
                continue only for so long as your event is actively selling on the Services
                and you are in compliance with the Terms.
                Thirty Friends connects those providing conferences and related services
                (“Organizers”) and those looking to attend those conferences and/or
                receive those services (“Attendees”). Attendees also include individuals
                who may present at or otherwise contribute content to such conferences
                (“Presenters”). When we use the word “you” in these Terms, it refers to any
                user, regardless of whether he or she is an Organizer, Attendee or
                Presenter, while if we use one of those specific terms, it only applies to that
                category of user.
                Before attending any conference or receiving any services from any
                Organizer (“Organizer Services”), Attendees are responsible for making
                their own determinations that the Organizer is suitable. Thirty Friends is
                only responsible for connecting Organizers and Attendees, and can’t and
                won’t be responsible for making sure that Organizer Services are actually
                provided or are up to a certain standard of quality. Thirty Friends similarly
                can’t and won’t be responsible for ensuring that information (including
                credentials) an Attendee or Organizer provides about himself or herself is
                accurate or up-to-date. We don’t control the actions of any Attendee or
                Organizer, and Organizers aren’t our employees.
                Organizers are not employees, partners, representatives, agents, joint
                venturers, independent contractors or franchisees of Thirty Friends. Thirty
                Friends is not the creator, organizer or owner of the Organizer Services,
                does not offer the Organizer Services and does not employ individuals to
                perform the Organizer Services. Rather, Thirty Friends’s Services allow
                Organizers to manage and promote the Organizer Services. You hereby
                acknowledge that Thirty Friends does not supervise, direct, control or
                monitor the Organizer Services and expressly disclaims any responsibility
                and liability for the Organizer Services, including but not limited to any
                warranty or condition of good and workmanlike services, warranty or
                condition of quality or fitness for a particular purpose, or compliance with
                any law, regulation, or code, all of which are the responsibility of Organizer.
                Attendees and Organizers must not enter into separate agreements outside
                of Thirty Friends relating to Organizer Services (“Outside Agreements”). If
                you do enter into any Outside Agreement we may terminate your Thirty
                Friends account, and you acknowledge that Thirty Friends is not a party to
                and isn’t responsible for enforcing any Outside Agreement. Additionally, if
                an Organizers enter any contract or agreement with any third party relating
                to Organizer Services (including without limitation, with any vendors,
                sponsors, advertisers, recruiters, etc.), Thirty Friends is not a party to, isn’t
                responsible for enforcing, and will have no liability relating to, any such
                contract or agreement.</p>

                <p>Licenses
                In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow
                other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in
                those User Submissions (see below for more information).
                For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Thirty Friends a license to
                translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example, making sure your
                content is viewable on a mobile device as well as a computer) and
                reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in
                each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail
                below. This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not
                affected.
                If you store a User Submission in your own personal Thirty Friends
                account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a
                “Personal User Submission”), you grant Thirty Friends the license above,
                as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User
                Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission
                accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.
                If you share a User Submission in a manner that only certain specified
                users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other
                users) (a “Limited Audience User Submission”), then you grant Thirty
                Friends the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and
                distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of
                making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other
                specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so. Also, you
                grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience
                User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by
                the functionality of the Services.
                If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner
                that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or if you provide
                us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions,
                improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the
                Services (each of the foregoing, a “Public User Submission”), then you
                grant Thirty Friends the licenses above, as well as a license to display,
                perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of
                making that Public User Submission accessible to all Thirty Friends users
                and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights
                necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in
                connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with Thirty
                Friends business. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license
                to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in
                it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.
                You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual,
                sublicensable, irrevocable, and worldwide, but you understand and agree
                that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from Thirty
                Friends records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable
                elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.
                Certain features of the Services allow you to share information with others,
                including through your Social Networking Services or other services where
                you have an account (“Third Party Accounts”). When Content is authorized
                for sharing, we will clearly identify the Content you are authorized to
                redistribute and the ways you may redistribute it, usually by providing a
                “share” button on or near the Content. If you share information from the
                Services with others through your Third Party Accounts, such as your
                Social Networking Services, you authorize Thirty Friends to share that
                information with the applicable Third Party Account provider. Please review
                the policies of any Third Party Account providers you share information with
                or through for additional information about how they may use your
                information. If you redistribute Content, you must be able to edit or delete
                any Content you redistribute, and you must edit or delete it promptly upon
                our request.
                Finally, you understand and agree that Thirty Friends, in performing the
                required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including
                you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and
                adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection
                networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include
                the rights to do so.</p>

                <p>Responsibility of actions using Thirty Friends
                Any information or Content publicly posted or privately transmitted through
                the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such
                Content originated, and you access all such information and Content at
                your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that
                information or Content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in
                connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action
                regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you
                may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you
                hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired
                Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users
                with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for
                which users gain access to the Services.
                You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the
                Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to
                do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.
                The Services may contain links or connections to third-party websites or
                services that are not owned or controlled by Thirty Friends. Thirty Friends
                has no control over such sites and resources and Thirty Friends is not
                responsible for and does not endorse such sites and resources. You further
                acknowledge and agree that Thirty Friends will not be responsible or liable,
                directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be
                caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any content, events,
                goods or services available on or through any such site or resource. Any
                dealings you have with third parties found while using the Service are
                between you and the third party. When you access third-party websites or
                use third-party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and
                that Thirty Friends is not responsible for such risks.
                Thirty Friends has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the
                content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in
                any third-party websites or by any third party that you interact with through
                the Services. In addition, Thirty Friends will not and cannot monitor, verify,
                censor or edit the content of any third-party site or service. We encourage
                you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and
                conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you
                visit or utilize. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless
                from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or
                service.
                Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through
                the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any
                other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such
                dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.
                You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate
                before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these
                third parties. You agree that Thirty Friends shall not be responsible or liable
                for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such
                dealings.
                If there is a dispute between participants on this site or Services, or
                between users and any third party, you agree that Thirty Friends is under
                no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with
                one or more other users, you release Thirty Friends, its directors, officers,
                employees, contractors, advisors, agents, and successors from loss,
                expenses, claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known
                or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising
                out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. You shall
                and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law
                of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: “A general release does not
                extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or
                suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and
                that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her
                settlement with the debtor or released party.”</p>
                <br/>
                <h2>Will Thirty Friends ever change the Services?</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>We are improving our Services, so they may change over time. We may
                temporarily or permanently modify, suspend or discontinue all or any part of
                the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain
                features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give
                you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would
                adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. We reserve the right to
                remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason
                (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that
                Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without
                notice. You acknowledge and agree that Thirty Friends will not be liable to
                you or any third party for taking any of the actions described in this
                paragraph.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Terminating use of Thirty Friends
                You’re free to do that at any time by contacting us at
                info@thirtyfriends.com; please refer to our Terms and Conditions, as well
                as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide
                to us after you have stopped using our Services.
                Thirty Friends is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of
                the Services or your account for any reason in our discretion, including your
                breach of these Terms. Thirty Friends has the sole right to decide whether
                you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms; for
                example, a Attendee who believes that an Organizer may be in breach of
                these Terms is not able to enforce these Terms against that Organizer.
                Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated
                with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your
                account. We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of our
                termination of your access to the Services, where, in Thirty Friends sole
                discretion, failure to do so would materially prejudice you. You agree that
                Thirty Friends will not be liable to you or any third-party as a result of its
                termination of your right to use or otherwise access the Services. Thirty
                Friends may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing
                the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice.
                If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at
                info@thirtyfriends.com – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t
                promise that we can recover or restore anything.
                Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms
                shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive
                termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any
                limitations on our liability, releases, disclaimers of warranties, any terms
                regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, choices of law and
                judicial forum, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without
                limitation the arbitration agreement.</p>

                MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
                Indemnity. You agree to indemnify and hold the Thirty Friends Parties
                harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual
                and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising
                from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the
                Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account),
                and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or
                action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the
                contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to
                deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification
                obligations hereunder).
                Assignment. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your
                rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by
                operation of law or otherwise) without Thirty Friends prior written consent.
                We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and
                obligations without consent.
                Choice of Law. These Terms are governed by and will be construed under
                the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State
                of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
                Arbitration Agreement. Please read the following ARBITRATION
                AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes
                and claims with Thirty Friends and limits the manner in which you can seek
                relief from Thirty Friends. Both you and Thirty Friends acknowledge and
                agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the
                subject matter of these Terms, Thirty Friends officers, directors, advisors,
                employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party
                beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these
                Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted
                the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary
                hereof.
                (a) Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. The parties
                shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or
                disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms
                directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to
                either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the
                dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in the state of
                Delaware. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in
                accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures
                (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial
                experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract
                disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS
                arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award
                rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                jurisdiction.
                (b) Costs of Arbitration. The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration
                fees. Thirty Friends will not pay or be responsible for arbitration fees. Thirty
                Friends will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the
                arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
                (c) Small Claims Court; Infringement. Either you or Thirty Friends may
                assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in the state of Delaware
                or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore,
                notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party
                shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time,
                from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened
                infringement, misappropriation or violation of a partys copyrights,
                trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.
                (d) Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND THIRTY FRIENDS WAIVE ANY
                CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND
                HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Thirty Friends
                are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.
                Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less
                costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review
                by a court. In any litigation between you and Thirty Friends over whether to
                vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND THIRTY FRIENDS
                WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the
                dispute be resolved by a judge.
                (e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES
                WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE
                ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON
                A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER
                CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR
                CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
                If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or
                unenforceable, neither you nor Thirty Friends is entitled to arbitration;
                instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g)
                below. ****
                (f) Opt-out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by
                sending electronic mail (e-mail) notice of your decision to opt out to the
                following address: info@thirtyfriends.com. You must include (i) your name
                and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number
                associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to
                opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.
                (g) Exclusive Venue. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any
                circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either
                you or Thirty Friends to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the
                subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration
                agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Thirty Friends
                agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be
                brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Delaware, or
                the federal district in which that county falls.
                (h) Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims
                brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be
                unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration
                Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will
                survive the termination of your relationship with Thirty Friends.
                Miscellaneous. You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and
                reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated
                with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Thirty
                Friends may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or
                for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way,
                any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights
                hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable
                or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent
                necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and
                effect and enforceable. You and Thirty Friends agree that these Terms are
                the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding
                between you and Thirty Friends, and that these Terms supersede and
                cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other
                understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby
                acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or
                joint venture of Thirty Friends, and you do not have any authority of any
                kind to bind Thirty Friends in any respect whatsoever.
                Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding arbitration
                agreement, you and Thirty Friends agree there are no third-party
                beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p>
